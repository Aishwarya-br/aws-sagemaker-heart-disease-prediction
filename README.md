## AWS SageMaker Heart Disease Prediction 

Machine learning can potentially play a significant role in helping doctors and scientists predict heart disease.  A personâ€™s chance of having a heart disease includes many factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, abnormal heart rate, and age.  In this sample, you will use AWS SageMaker to train a linear learner algorithm that can potentially predict the presence of heart disease.
